# Basic Interactions

This is the part of the game where the player is introduced to the elementary controls of the game and learns the basic control mechanisms, ideally in some intuitive and natural manner. They need to be able to understand how to move around in the environment, how to interact with it (opening doors and containers, picking up items from the ground, etc.). If the game offers some more advanced interactions that are bound to a certain skill such as lockpicking, pickpocketing, finding secret doors and areas, finding traps, etc., the player may be introduced to these as well, but usually just briefly and most of this topic is discussed in [Discovering new/advanced interactions](advancedInteractions.md).

An important part of this part of the game is the introduction of inventory and equipment, especially items that can be consumed or used. If the game allows the player to use magic, he should be given some basics.
