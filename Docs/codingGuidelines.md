# General Guidelines

1. Use the TDD development cycle as much as possible:
    1.  Determine a golden-path scenario for missing feature
    1.  Draw it out
    1.  Convert to written language (native->english)
    1.  Convert to comments
    1.  Write new test from the comments
    1.  Implement all that is missing
1. Fake it till you make it  
1. 0-1-many
1. Refactor everything
