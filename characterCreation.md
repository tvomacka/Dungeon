# Character Creation

Unless a pre-made character is provided to the player, they will usually create a new character using an editor, that is unavailable later in the game. This is caused by the fact that many of the choices are one-time and irreversible (e.g., sex, build, hair color and other mostly design choices). Parts of this editor might be avialable for character screen and leveling up.
